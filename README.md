# Python Image Drawer
Input an image, and the program will draw it pixel by pixel

(Quite slow for large images)

Run the program, type the image path, type in scale (not 100% sure if this works??), and then move your mouse to any drawing program.

(Make sure that you're zoomed out enough so that when the mouse moves, it goes to another pixel)

I'll make it faster later maybe
