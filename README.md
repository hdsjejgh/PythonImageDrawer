# Python Image Drawer
Input an image, and the program will draw it pixel by pixel

(Quite slow for very large images (If the drawing is set too fast, most programs I've tested (Paint 3d, MS Paint, MS Paint from 2001) crash or freeze))

Run the program, type the image path, type in scale (how many pixels to jump per pixel in the image), and then move your mouse to any drawing program.

(Make sure that you're zoomed out enough so that when the mouse moves, it goes to another pixel)
